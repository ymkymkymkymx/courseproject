### Reflextion
#### It took me 3 hours to figure out that I should use IP address instead of localhost. It is not that I haven't tried IP address in the first place, but that I had not get both container running and IP address in right format in the same time until I searched the problem on stackoverflow. So in conclusion, stackoverflow is the best.
