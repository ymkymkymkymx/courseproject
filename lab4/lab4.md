## Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
* By choosing a license you can regulate the way people to use/copy your code.
* Also it invites people to help with your project, and allows others to use your code.(People don't dare to deal with a project without a license)

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
* A project without an explicit license means that its author reserves all his or her rights over the project. It is very likely that the project will have a license in the future, and if it is not open-source or it is copyleft, it will cause a lot of trouble for you. 
* Moreover since it doesn't have a explicit license, it is likely that this is a private project and it doesn't want people to join. Also, there won't be much people working on the project and the project might be dead at any time and all your work could be wasted.
 
## Failure to follow the Open System Model Section
* I agree with the claim that the failure to follow the Open System Model Section is one of the reasons why Web beat Gopher. As it is suggested in the passage, Web got the important idea that their users can also be their contributors, which helped them developed fast. On the contrary, Gopher decided that they want to be in full controll of their project, and to make money through the payment of a licensing fee for hosts with a .com domain which drove its developers mad and forked from the project(without nowadays fork support, there is no contribute back to the Gopher). As we can see, Gopher did worse than Web on the open system model and lost its developers which should be one one of the reasons that make web better that Gopher.
  
## Why linux choose GPL v2
* Linux was started by an individual developer, by choosing GPL, he makes the project open source and receives the support from the community. Beacause GPL protects the right of the source developer and forced the GPL license on the derivatives, the Linux system can spread out and still being Linux. If not licensed as open source software, Linux cannot get the help from the community and one man cannot make such a difference. If licensed as LGPL, Liunx might lost its name on its derivatives.
