## Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
* By choosing a license you can regulate the way people to use/copy your code.
* Also it invites people to help with your project, and allows others to use your code.(People don't dare to deal with a project without a license)

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
* A project without an explicit license means that its author reserves all his or her rights over the project. It is very likely that the project will have a license in the future, and if it is not open-source or it is copyleft, it will cause a lot of trouble for you. 
* Moreover since it doesn't have a explicit license, it is likely that this is a private project and it doesn't want people to join. Also, there won't be much people working on the project and the project might be dead at any time and all your work could be wasted.
